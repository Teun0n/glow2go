Glow2Go System README

Glow2Go was developed as our group project for the 2nd project course in Computer engineering https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/123704/Computerteknologiprojekt-II. This README will provide an overview of the system, its features.

Overview
The Glow2Go System is designed to provide a safe and intuitive pathway for users navigating from their bedroom to the bathroom during nighttime hours. It achieves this by controlling up to 5 sensors strategically placed along the pathway and up to 5 LED strips that illuminate the way.

Features
Sensor Control: The system can interface with up to 5 sensors placed along the pathway to detect motion or proximity.
LED Strip Control: It can also control up to 5 LED strips that provide illumination to guide the user along the path.
Database Integration: Utilizes SQL as a database to store sensor data and user-defined settings.
Web Interface: A web application allows users to view logged data, configure active time-frame for the system, and adjust settings remotely.
